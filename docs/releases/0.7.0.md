# Version 0.7.0. What's new?

The version number is synchronized with the version of labmate.

## Quickly:

- Code formatting
- Easier navigation
- Find inside the text (with ctrl+F)
- Mermaid preview

## Code formatting

Now a code looks much nicer.

## Easier navigation

Now data that ends with "\*.py" are looked for sections.
To put a new section use comments like:

```python
# ====== Section 1 ======
```

The pattern used for search is `# *={3,} *([\\w ]*) *={3,}`. Therefore, following types of comments are also possible:

```python
# ==== Section 1 ====
#      ===========   Section 1   ==========
```

## Find inside the text

Use shortcut ctrl+F to find inside the text.

## Open saved plot

## Mermaid preview

To make the app itself light, mermaid preview is done by opening html page in the browser. But it still works.

## Minor features
